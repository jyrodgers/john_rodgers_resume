# The Resume for John Y. Rodgers

## Overview

This repository hosts my professional resume in LaTeX format.
LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system, offers the flexibility and aesthetic appeal needed for a standout resume.
Keeping the resume in LaTeX within this repository allows for efficient version control and ease of editing, particularly with tools like Vim.

## Resume Content

The `resume.tex` file contains a comprehensive list of my relevant experiences, skills, and accomplishments.
It is meticulously crafted to showcase my professional journey and capabilities.

## Tailoring for Job Applications

To ensure that my resume aligns perfectly with the requirements of different job applications, I adopt a unique approach:

- **Branching Strategy**: For each job application, I create a new branch in this repository.
This branch serves as a dedicated space to customize my resume for that specific application.
- **Content Customization**: In the respective branches, I edit the resume.tex file to add, remove, or rephrase bullet points.
This customization ensures that the resume resonates with the job description and highlights the most relevant aspects of my experience for that role.

## Generating the PDF

To convert the `resume.tex` file into a PDF, which is a widely accepted format for job applications, I use the following command in the terminal:

```
pdflatex resume.tex
```

This command compiles the LaTeX file into a neatly formatted PDF, ready for submission.
