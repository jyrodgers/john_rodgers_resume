\textbf{Viasat} \hfill San Diego, CA\\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill August 2018 - November 2023\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developed \textbf{C++} library to manage \textbf{UDP} and \textbf{OpenSSL} secured \textbf{DTLS} connections, provided both client/server roles, and \textbf{multi-threading} for heartbeat monitoring and packet queuing.
	\item Reduced time to build/test application suite by >3 hours through proposing and directing an intern project that implemented modern \textbf{CMake} patterns, \textbf{Docker} image patterns and upgrading build tools.
	\item Served as \textbf{Scrum Master}, while primarily a developer, I also streamlined project workflows, managed tasks in \textbf{JIRA} and collaborated with leaders across teams to drive successful project outcomes.
	\item \textbf{Streamed} monitoring/analysis data from \textbf{Docker}/\textbf{Kubernetes} \textbf{containers} with multi-client to server log/metric publishing microservice leveraging \textbf{gRPC}, \textbf{Fluent Bit}, \textbf{Kafka}, \textbf{Grafana} and \textbf{Splunk}.
	\item Reduced time to complete \textbf{code reviews} by revitalizing processes, empowering developers of all skills to actively contribute/learn from every PR, integrated \textbf{GitHub} tools to streamline review process.
	\item Optimized \textbf{CMake} build process by developing Docker/Kubernetes container synchronizing artifacts stored in Perforce, leveraged \textbf{Bash} for scripting, volume mounts for file transfer to host.
	\item Optimized deployment process by regularly using \textbf{Jenkins} to \textbf{deploy}, \textbf{debug} and \textbf{administer} Linux-based VMs used to develop, test, and deploy Docker/Kubernetes containers.
	\item Delivered critical \textbf{on-call technical support} ensuring rapid issue resolution and system reliability, demonstrating a deep understanding of system architecture and cross-team product integration.
	\item Lowered dependency on individual expertise by initiating peer education program, conducting needs assessments, mobilizing subject matter experts, and creating a comprehensive video knowledge base.
	\item Boosted technical proficiency by starting junior developer skill-up sessions resulting in a knowledge base of \textbf{Zettelkasten} and \textbf{Di√°taxis} based notes populated with \textbf{C4}, \textbf{Sequence}, and \textbf{State} Diagrams.
	\item Eliminated \textbf{cybersecurity} risks by monitoring vulnerabilitites using \textbf{Blackduck} and \textbf{Security Scorecard}, JIRA tracking of resolution, leading to a perfect security assessment for the project.
	\item Regularly used complex \textbf{regular expressions} for file identification by name and content with tools such as \textbf{find}, \textbf{ripgrep}, and \textbf{ag}, applied techniques for mass text editing in \textbf{Vim} and \textbf{Obsidian}.
	\item Dedicated to \textbf{professional development} through \textbf{methodical study}, \textbf{organized note-taking} using Zettelkasten method, systematic reviews using \textbf{spaced repetition flashcards}.
