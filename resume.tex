\textbf{Viasat} \hfill San Diego, CA\\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill August 2018 - November 2023\\
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ensured compliance with rigorous security standards in cross-virtual machine communications by designing and owning a \textbf{multi-threaded} \textbf{C++} library that managed \textbf{OpenSSL}-secured \textbf{DTLS} connections.
	\item Enhanced fault diagnosis \& system reliability with \textbf{C++} library that created files detailing recent activity from failed \textbf{Docker}/\textbf{Kubernetes} containers, enabling more precise troubleshooting and system insights.
	\item Enhanced alerting and monitoring by developing data publishing microservice that streamed critical data from containers leveraging \textbf{gRPC} for transmission, \textbf{Fluent Bit} for filtering and enrichment, \textbf{Kafka} for publication.
	\item Significantly reduced application suite build/test times by \textbf{>3 hours} through proposing, planning, and leading a summer intern project focused on process optimization and efficiency in a containerized build environment.
	\item Deep intellectual curiosity and passion about learning through \textbf{methodical study}, \textbf{organized note-taking} using \textbf{Zettelkasten} method, systematic reviews using \textbf{spaced repetition flashcards}.
	\item Boosted team velocity by 25\% over three-year tenure as a \textbf{Scrum Master} for 8-member development team, all while excelling in my primary role as a software engineer.
	\item Accelerated code review completions and development quality by revitalizing processes and training, fostering clear communication, faster issue resolution, and increased team knowledge.
	\item Lowered dependency on individual expertise by initiating peer education program, conducting needs assessments, mobilizing subject matter experts, and creating a comprehensive video knowledge base.
	\item \textbf{Deployed}, \textbf{debugged} and \textbf{administered} \textbf{Linux}-based \textbf{Virtual Machine}s using \textbf{Jenkins} to develop, test, and deploy \textbf{Docker}/\textbf{Kubernetes} containers.
	\item Ensured rapid issue resolution and system reliability through critical \textbf{on-call technical support}, demonstrating a deep understanding of system architecture and cross-team product integration.
	\item Streamlined artifact synchronization between legacy \textbf{Perforce} and current \textbf{Git}/\textbf{CMake} build system using dedicated \textbf{Docker} container. Implemented \textbf{Bash} scripting and \textbf{volume mount}s for efficient file transfer.
	\item Eliminated \textbf{cybersecurity} risks by monitoring vulnerabilitites using \textbf{Blackduck} and \textbf{Security Scorecard}, \textbf{JIRA} tracking of resolution, leading to a perfect security assessment for the project.
	\item Mastered complex \textbf{regular expressions} for file identification by name and content with tools such as \textbf{find}, \textbf{ripgrep}, and \textbf{ag}, applied techniques for mass text editing in \textbf{Vim} and \textbf{Obsidian}.
