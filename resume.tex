\textbf{Viasat} \hfill San Diego, CA\\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill August 2018 - November 2023\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
    \item Reduced time to build/test application suite by >3 hours through proposing and directing an intern project that implemented modern \textbf{CMake} patterns, \textbf{Docker} image patterns and upgrading build tools.
    \item Optimized deployment process by regularly deploying, debugging and administering \textbf{Linux-based VMs} used to develop, test, and deploy Docker/\textbf{Kubernetes} containers.
    \item Designed and implemented \textbf{C++} library to manage UDP and OpenSSL secured DTLS connections, provided both client/server roles, and \textbf{multi-threading} for heartbeat monitoring and packet queuing.
    \item Served as \textbf{Scrum Master} for 8-member development team for 3 years, streamlined project workflows, managed tasks in \textbf{JIRA} and collaborated with leaders across teams to drive successful project outcomes.
    \item Regularly used complex \textbf{regular expressions} in terminal for file identification by name and content with tools such as find, ripgrep, and ag, applied techniques for mass text editing in \textbf{Vim} and Obsidian.
    \item Reduced time to complete code reviews by revitalizing processes, empowering developers of all skills to actively contribute/learn from every PR, integrated \textbf{GitHub} tools to streamline review process.
	\item Optimized CMake build process by developing Linux-based Docker/Kubernetes container synchronizing artifacts stored in Perforce, leveraged \textbf{Bash} for scripting, volume mounts for file transfer to host.
    \item Streamed monitoring/analysis data from Docker/Kubernetes containers with multi-client to server log/metric publishing microservice leveraging \textbf{gRPC}, \textbf{Fluent Bit}, \textbf{Kafka}, \textbf{Grafana} and \textbf{Splunk}.
    \item Lowered dependency on individual expertise by initiating peer education program, conducting needs assessments, mobilizing subject matter experts, and creating a comprehensive video knowledge base.
    \item Recovered data from failed Linux-based Docker/Kubernetes containers by creating "black box" files, leveraging multiple threads, \textbf{circular buffers}, \textbf{IPC}-based communication, and remote volume store.
    \item Boosted technical proficiency by starting junior developer skill-up sessions resulting in a knowledge base of \textbf{Zettelkasten} and \textbf{Di√°taxis} based notes populated with \textbf{C4}, \textbf{Sequence}, and \textbf{State} Diagrams.
    \item Delivered critical \textbf{on-call} technical support ensuring rapid issue resolution and system reliability, demonstrating a deep understanding of system architecture and cross-team product integration.
