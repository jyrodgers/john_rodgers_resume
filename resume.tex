\textbf{Viasat} \hfill San Diego, CA\\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill 2018 - 2023\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Designed and implemented C++ library to manage UDP and OpenSSL-secured DTLS connections, provided both client/server roles, and multi-threading for heartbeat monitoring and packet queuing.
	\item Provided real-time data for monitoring and analysis by developing multi-client to server log publishing microservice ( Docker / Kubernetes ) leveraging gRPC, Fluent Bit, Kafka, Grafana and Splunk.
	\item Recovered data from failed microservices ( Docker / Kubernetes ) by creating 'black box' files, leveraging multiple threads, circular buffers, IPC-based communication, and remote volume store.
	\item Optimized build process by developing file synchronization microservice ( Docker / Kubernetes ) to integrate artifacts stored in Perforce with CMake build system, leveraged bash for scripting, volume mounts for file transfer to host.
	\item Delivered critical on-call technical support ensuring rapid issue resolution and system reliability, demonstrating a deep understanding of system architecture and cross-team product integration.
	\item Served as Scrum Master for 8-member development team for 3 years, streamlined project workflows, managed tasks in JIRA and collaborated with leaders across teams to drive successful project outcomes.
	\item Reduced time to build suite of applications by >3 hours through proposing, planning, and directing a summer intern project.
	\item Decreased time to complete code reviews by revitalizing processes, empowering developers of all skills to actively contribute and learn from every PR, while integrating GitHub tools to streamline review process.
	\item Lowered dependency on individual expertise by initiating peer education program, conducting needs assessments, mobilizing subject matter experts, and creating a comprehensive video knowledge base.
	\item Boosted team technical proficiency by initiating weekly junior developer tech skill-up sessions resulting in a comprehensive system knowledge base of Zettelkasten and Diátaxis based notes populated with C4, Sequence, and State Diagrams.
	\item Eliminated cybersecurity risks by monitoring vulnerabilitites using Blackduck and Security Scorecard, JIRA tracking of resolution, leading to a perfect security assessment for the project.
