\textbf{Viasat} \hfill San Diego, CA\\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill August 2018 - November 2023\\
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improved compliance with rigorous security standards in cross-virtual machine communications by designing and owning a \textbf{C++} library that managed \textbf{OpenSSL}-secured \textbf{DTLS} connections.
        \begin{itemize}
	        \item Prioritized developer with robust API, allowing easy setup of encryption, timeout, SSL roles, and peer addresses, abstracting away complexities of the underlying implementation.
	        \item Enhanced connection stability by integrating multi-threading for heartbeat monitoring, facilitating automatic re-establishment of SSL connections as required for continuous operation.
	        \item Boosted efficiency and throughput by employing a multi-threaded approach to queue and send packets, optimizing network performance and data handling.
        \end{itemize}
	\item Enabled fault diagnosis \& system reliability with \textbf{C++} library that created files detailing recent activity from failed \textbf{Docker}/\textbf{Kubernetes} containers, enabling more precise troubleshooting and system insights.
        \begin{itemize}
	        \item Optimized log management using circular buffers for priority-based storage, implemented \textbf{multi-threading}, and established \textbf{IPC}-based communication to coordinate across multiple containers.
        \end{itemize}
	\item Enhanced alerting and monitoring by developing data publishing microservice that streamed critical data from containers leveraging \textbf{gRPC} for transmission, \textbf{Fluent Bit} for filtering and enrichment, \textbf{Kafka} for publication.
        \begin{itemize}
	        \item Improved communication efficiency by developing a \textbf{C++} client library with auto-generated \textbf{gRPC} sources, simplifying client initialization, request creation, and stub method invocations.
	        \item Optimized data processing workflows using \textbf{Fluent Bit} for advanced filtering/enrichment, leading to efficient, content-based routing and improved data stream management with Stream Processor.
        \end{itemize}
	\item Significantly reduced application suite build/test times by \textbf{>3 hours} through proposing, planning, and leading an intern project focused on process optimization and efficiency in a containerized build environment.
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item Effectively managed and mentored participants, providing guidance through the project's technical and operational complexities, ensuring successful project completion and a valuable learning experiences.
    \end{itemize}
	\item Boosted team velocity by 25\% over three-year tenure as a \textbf{Scrum Master} for 8-member development team, all while excelling in my primary role as a developer.
	\item Accelerated code review completions and development quality by revitalizing processes and training, fostering clear communication, faster issue resolution, and increased team knowledge.
	\item \textbf{Deployed}, debugged and administered \textbf{Linux-based VMs} using \textbf{Jenkins} to develop, test, and deploy \textbf{Docker}/\textbf{Kubernetes} containers.
	\item Lowered dependency on individual expertise by initiating peer education program, conducting needs assessments, mobilizing subject matter experts, and creating a comprehensive video knowledge base.
	\item Deep intellectual curiosity and passion about learning through \textbf{methodical study}, \textbf{organized note-taking} using \textbf{Zettelkasten} method, systematic reviews using \textbf{spaced repetition flashcards}.
